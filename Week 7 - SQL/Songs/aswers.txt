An approach that could enhance the precision of this measurement would be to increase the number of variables considered, as well as the number of songs analyzed. By expanding the set of variables to be analyzed, including additional musical characteristics beyond those already mentioned, such as timbre, instrumentation, and harmonic complexity, a more comprehensive understanding of the listener's musical preferences could be obtained.
